### Pull Requests

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Commit your changes** with clear commit messages
6. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes

### Code Structure

```python
def function_name(param1: str, param2: int) -> bool:
    """
    Brief description of function.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    # Implementation
    return True
```

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant
- First line should be 50 characters or less
- Provide detailed description in commit body if needed

Example:
```
Add documentation search feature

- Implemented automatic detection of code queries
- Added official documentation scraping
- Integrated results into context builder
- Added tests for documentation search

Fixes #123
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Run self-tests: `python BlackholeFile.py --selftest`
- Test with different API configurations
- Test edge cases and error handling

### Documentation

- Update README.md for new features
- Add inline comments for complex logic
- Update docstrings when changing function behavior
- Create examples for new features

## Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pravi7072/Blackhole.git
   cd Blackhole
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   ```

5. **Create feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
